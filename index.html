				<h1>CAUTION!!!</h1>
				<h3>Competition cautions are nothing new to racing. When the Camping World Truck Series was first formed, 
					the schedule was comprised of short-tracks that didn't have large pit roads. In addition, the teams 
					had small crews to save money. For several years a "halftime break" competition caution was thrown 
					so teams could pit in tight pit roads, and have time to do their work, coming back out without losing 
					any positions. The Xfinity Series also threw cautions so teams could take their time on very tight pit 
					roads where crews would be in danger. The cars would return to the positions they had entering pit 
					stops, after completing a slow, safe service.</h3>
